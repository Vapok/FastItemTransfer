# Fast Item Transfer by Vapok

This is a lightweight Quality of Life module for moving items quickly between Player Inventory and Containers.

Using the Right-Click action while hovering over an item when a container is open, will instantly move the item to the other container or player inventory.

There is very little configuration. Simply enable or disable.
